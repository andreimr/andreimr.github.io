### Current Goals
I've finally taken the time to set up this GitHub account, after much procrastination, with the intention of creating repositories to support personal exploration into several topics, as well as a GitHub Pages site documenting it all. The topics are:
 - **Neurosymbolic AI**. I'm fascinated by what so-called foundational models _cannot_ do. They cannot plan or reason (formally, in the "traditional AI" sense), contrary to popular opinion. There are lots of efforts in the research community to imbue models with the missing capabilities. And I'm here for it.
 - **C++ 23**. I taught myself C++ when I was a kid, and so I have always loved that language. I also hate it. (Our relationship's complicated.) Those damn ISOC++ working group(s) have overdone it, convoluting the language with features people love in other languages. But I'm compelled to master them nonetheless.
 - **Actually _Doing_ Deep Learning**. Deep Learning is really hard to get right, and I care very much about how people manage to do it. My focus here won't be on theory, but on DL as a craft. (Or as alchemy?)
 - **GPU Programming**. I think performance engineering is fun as hell, but I'm really not very good at it. ("Andrei is too much of a theoretician" or "philosopher" are accusations my colleagues level against me regularly.) I'm compelled to become much better at it.

My interests are actually at the intersection of software engineering and artificial intelligence research. I used to be an academic who worked on organizing Robotics, Computer Vision, Augmented Reality, good old-fashioned AI and Machine Learning using software engineering principles. Then, I did R&D for 11 years at a nearly-century-old Japanese manufacturing company. I didn't work as much in that intersection like I thought I would. So I've stopped doing that, with the intention of returning to my root interests.
